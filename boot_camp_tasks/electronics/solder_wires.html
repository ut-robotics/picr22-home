<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Cut about 5 cm pieces of red and black wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strip about 5 mm of insulation from each end of the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightly twist the strands of the wire at each end to prevent the strands from separating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some flux to the ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover the ends with some solder.
Make sure to evenly coat all around the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add solder into the ends of the bullet connectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remelt the solder in the connector and at the end of the wire and push the wire into the connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the wire straight until the solder solidifies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some solder to the pads on the PCB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the end of the wire onto the pads and remelt the solder on the pad and at the end of the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the wire in place until the solder has solidified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut pieces of heatshrink.
Red for red wire and black for black wire.
Heatshrink should cover all the conductive parts when the connector is connected and about 5 mm of the wire insulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the heatshrink onto the connector and heat it with hot air.
Suitable temperature is around 150 - 200 degrees.</p>
